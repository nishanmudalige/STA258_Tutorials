# STA258_Tutorial

## To Do:

- Complete Tutorial 1 + make a section of additional problems to expand on tutorial content
- Add a `.csv` file upload (with a link to the raw version of the file) and add questions where students use R commands on the file
- Move q2 to the end and add sub questions to aid students


## High level outline

- Week 1 (No tutorials)
- Week 2 (Tutorial 1)
  - Introduction to R and data structures
- Week 3 (Tutorial 2)
  - Descriptive Statistics
  - Commands such as `mean`, `var`, `sd`, `summary`
  - Other packages such as `skimr`, introduction to `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`
  - Build on tutorial 1, use a data set to analyze summary stats, and create plots
- Week 4 (Tutorial 3)
  - Distributions: Normal, Chi-square, t, F
  - `pnorm`, `qnorm`, `pt`, `qt`, `pchisq`, `qchisq`, `pf`, `qf`
  - **Include plots** to illustrate the regions of interest under each density
    - Use `plotly` (preferred) or `ggplot2`
  - Central limit theorem + LLN
- Week 5 (Tutorial 4)
  - One sample confidence intervals on the mean
    - sigma known
    - sigma unknown
  - One sample confidence intervals on a proportion
