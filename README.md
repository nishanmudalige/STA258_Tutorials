# STA258_Tutorial

## To Do:

- Complete Tutorial 1 + make a section of additional problems to expand on tutorial content
- Add a `.csv` file upload (with a link to the raw version of the file) and add questions where students use R commands on the file
- Move q2 to the end and add sub questions to aid students
